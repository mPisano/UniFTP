The simple ftp library based on C# supports most of the ftp protocol extension functions such as ftps and i pv6, and can be cross-platform through mono.

## Components

* UniFTP#Server FTP server software based on UniFTP.Server
* UniFTP.Client FTP Client Library (Planning)

### Attention

This project has nothing to do with [uni ftp] (http://linux.softpedia.com/get/internet/ftp/uni ftp 28869.shtml) (currently renamed [complete ftp] (http://enterprisedt.com/products/completeftp/)). This project does not use the edt ftp component.

UniFTP is a FTP server lib & software written in C#. It's based on Sharp FTP Server, but have been rewritted and enhanced.

Many bugs in SharpServer have been fixed, such as encoding, path parsing, performance counters, FTPS and so on.

Many new functions are added, such as cross-platform(Mono) support, FTPS support, RESTart support, new usergroup, log and virtual file system(I spend most time on them).
